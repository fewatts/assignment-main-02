                <h3 class="tittle-recipe">Bacon-Wrapped Pesto Pork Tenderloin</h3>
                <p>I love to serve this family-favorite tenderloin—maybe
                    because of the compliments that come with it! When the
                    weather warms up, we grill it instead.

                <h3 class="tittle-recipe">Pork Tenderloin with Three-Berry Salsa</h3>
                <p>My husband came home from a work meeting that had served pork with a spicy blueberry salsa. He was amazed at how tasty it was, so I came up with my own rendition without seeing or tasting what he had. It took several tries, but this is the delicious result. —Angie Phillips, Tarzana, California
